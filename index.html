      Here is all you need to know about relative file paths:
        Starting with “/” returns to the root directory and starts there
        Starting with “../” moves one directory backwards and starts there
        Starting with “../../” moves two directories backwards and starts there (and so on…)
        To move forward, just start with the first subdirectory and keep moving forward -->
